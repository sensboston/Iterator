Clone and build the app, then run PEx2000.exe, open "Summary report" and play for a little. Be careful with "OCT testing" button :)

Fill free to clone/fork/pr to this repo, and try your sophisticated algorythms to bruteforce "People Express" game!

Note #1: to be able to obtain "Summary report" properties, you should open this report on PEx2000.exe

Note #2: my pseudo "OCR" algorythm is still not 100% good; need to improve screen copying procedure for better quality.
